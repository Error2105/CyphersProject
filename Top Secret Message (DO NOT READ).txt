Dear Mr. Turing, we have intercepted a message from the Germans, and we need YOU to decode it. We suspect it contains
crucial information for our landings in France.

The message we found is: KKSSD HFFQD IYENJ TCBAK MYYVY GUDCS

Unfortunately, we do not know the settings on the Enigma Machine used to encrypt this message.
You will need to figure those out yourself from the clues our spies have gathered.

Clue 1) We suspect that SHA was used for the rotor settings, but something seems off about this...

Clue 2) A total of five plugs were used to encode this message.

Clue 3) We recieved a threat from the Germans that "WE RECOMMEND THAT ABANDONING IS THE KEY TO YOUR SUCCESS"

Clue 4) The enemy has been leaving their cyphers to rot for 13 days.

Clue 5) We stole the following text: QX RS CR TP KI. We suspect it's another encoded message.

Clue 6) Our ability to recover the rotor positions is extremely time sensitive.

Clue 7) Whoever encoded this message didn't bother to change the settings from todays daily settings.
